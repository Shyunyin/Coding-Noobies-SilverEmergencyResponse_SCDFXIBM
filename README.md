# **Short description of our solution and our idea**
According to the Health Promotion Board Singapore, about one-third of elderly Singaporeans aged 60 and above have recurring falls. Falling down at an old age can be detrimental as older people have more fragile bones, are more likely to have complications from surgeries and have problems recovering. 

Our team has identified elderly who are living alone as a particularly vulnerable group amongst the elderly. This is because the elderly in this group do not have family members or relatives living with them who can provide help in the case of a fall or alert emergency medical services. Furthermore, we identified that bathrooms are commonplace for falls due to the slippery surfaces. Therefore, our team’s solution aims to detect such falls, alert the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and Community First Responders (CFRs) for the elderly and collect data that is useful for the personnel arriving at the scene. 

There are two phases to our solution. Phase One encompasses data collection via motion sensors to detect a fall so that SCDF is alerted as soon as it occurs. This is of utmost importance as the elderly living alone do not have anyone else who can alert emergency medical services and may be immobilised after the fall.  

Phase Two is to maximise the effectiveness of CFRs who arrive early to the scene before SCDF personnel through Watson Translation. This is to make communication between the injured senior citizen. Clear communication will allow the CFR to make a better assessment of the situation and provide the necessary aid accordingly. This can significantly impact the outcome of the fall for the elderly. Furthermore, the communication between the CFR and the elderly can be transcribed and sent to SCDF personnel who are on the way so they can remain updated.

# **Our Detailed Solution**
More detail is available here:<

# **Step-by-step Installation Details**
**Part 1: Setting up your accelerometer containing motion sensor (hardware) and connecting it to Node-Red (software)**
Step 1. Connect your PC to Arduino Beetle Ble using a USB cable
Step 2. Connect the accelerometer to Arduino using wires
Step 3. Code Arduino with Python (“Accelerometer_containing_motion_sensor _and_timer.py” and “Accelerometer_with_timer” as stored in Github)
Step 4: Disconnect Arduino from PC
Step 5: Using the built-in bluetooth function in Arduino, connect it to a device that node-red is installed in 
Step 6: Move the accelerometer to obtain input from it  
Step 7: Do steps 1-6 for 4 more identical accelerometers

**Part 2: Setting up a Watson Assistant**
Step 1. From the IBM Cloud catalog, provision an instance of Watson Assistant.
Step 2. Launch the Watson Assistant service.
Step 3. Create assistant
Step 4. Name the Watson Assistant instance [Silver Emergency Response]
Step 5. Click ‘Add Dialog’ skill to add this to your assistant.
Step 6. Click Import skill > Choose JSON file and import the skill-silveremergencyresponse.json file
Step 7. Go back to the All Assistants page to open ‘Settings’.
Step 8. On the Settings tab, click API Details on the left and make a note of the Assistant ID and Api Key for future use.
Step 9. Go back to the ‘All Assistants’ page and click on the ‘Skills link’.
Step 10. On the ‘Skill page’, open ‘View API Details’.
Step 11. On the ‘Skill Details’ page, make note of the Skill ID for future use.
Step 12. Go back to your dialog skill and click on the ‘Preview Link’ button on the side to get a link to test and verify your assistant.
Step 13. Type in ‘Thump’ to mimic the sound of a falling elderly and to trigger the motion sensor, which would activate the [name of our device]. Continue to answer the questions that the [name] asks to experience how it works! 

**Part 3: Setting up node-red chatbot**
Step 1. Node-red must be installed on IBM cloud so that data can be accessed by SCDF and CFR
Step 2. Install the following dependencies into the flow:
Node-red-node-ui-microphone
Node-red-dashboard
Node-red-node-watson
Node-contrib-play-audio
This can be done by using IBM cloud toolchain and the git repository in IBM cloud to add the following packages to the package.json file.
"node-red-node-ui-microphone":"0.x",
"node-red-dashboard":"2.x",
"Node-red-contrib-play-audio":"2.x",
Step 3: Create a flow as such:
